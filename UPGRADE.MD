# Upgrade guide

## From 0.4.1 to 0.5.0
You should upgrade your dependency on TypeScript to 1.8.x

## From 0.4.0 to 0.4.1
No modification mandatory with this release.

## From 0.3.2 to 0.4.0
The way we construct the dist vendor css bundle has changed.
In your vendor.scss file, if you import third party stylesheets from jspm_packages or from node_modules, then you'll need to change the relative path.
Assuming that you have the same file structure as described in the [readme](README.md), then the import should look like this:

```
@import '../../jspm_packages/github/necolas/normalize.css@3.0.3/normalize.css'; // the path refers to the file at BUILD time
```

## From 0.3.1 to 0.3.2
No modification mandatory with this release.

## From 0.3.0 to 0.3.1
No modification mandatory with this release.

## From 0.2.3 to 0.3.0
The gulp scripts-typescript task has changed. Now, instead of using an hardcoded list of paths to compile, it loads what you have configured in your tsconfig.json configuration file.
Make sure that you DO have:
* a tsconfig.json file :)
* the `rootDir` property defined and pointing to "./app", otherwise the build will fail (more precisely, `npm run serve` will fail).
* the `outDir` property defined and pointing to "./.tmp", (same issue otherwise)

I've updated the example `tsconfig.json` file in the README, so please do refer to that.

Check out the CHANGELOG list of known issues, there's an important catch with typings.


Next, the babel dependency was upgraded to 6.4.x, meaning that it probably would be best for you to also upgrade.
The following babel dependencies should be upgraded to 6.4.x:
* babel-core
* babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs

## From 0.2.2 to 0.2.3
No modification mandatory with this release.

## From 0.2.1 to 0.2.2
If you are using Angular 2, you should set the minifyProductionHTML option to false (see changelog)

## From 0.2.0 to 0.2.1
No modification mandatory with this release.

## From 0.1.1 to 0.2.0
#61 breaks compatibility with existing projects.

In order to fix this, you need to rename app/core/core.bootstrap.ts to core/boot.ts (and rename the template accordingly) and ensure that you adapt app/index.html as well.

If you're not willing to rename as proposed above, then you can define the `distEntryPoint` option.

Here's an example gulpfile.babel.js:

```
"use strict";

import gulp from "gulp";

import modernWebDevBuild from "modern-web-dev-build";

let options = {};

options.distEntryPoint = "core/core.bootstrap";
```

## From 0.1.0 to 0.1.1
To upgrade you can simply increment the dependency version in your project.
To benefit from the unit testing support, you should add a karma.conf.js file to your project. Check the readme for details about its contents (though you can configure Karma as you wish/need).

## From 0.0.x to 0.1.0
First, add a .babelrc file to your project; the minimal contents should be as follows:
```
{
	"presets": ["es2015"],
	"plugins": ["transform-es2015-modules-commonjs"],
	"comments": false
}
```

That file is necessary to configure Babel 6 correctly. Basically, it instructs Babel to load all the es2015 plugins and generate commonjs modules.

Alternatively, you can include that configuration in your package.json file (refer to Babel's documentation).

Next, you need to update your package.json dependencies:
* any dependency on "babel" should be removed as it is no longer necessary (do this both for the jspm and npm dependencies)
* in the JSPM dependencies you should have
  * `"babel-runtime": "npm:babel-runtime@^6.1.18",` (6.1.x or higher)
* in the JSPM dev dependencies you should have
  * `"babel": "npm:babel-core@^6.1.21",` (6.1.x or higher)
* in the npm dependencies, you should have
  * `"babel-runtime": "6.1.x",`

Finally, in the npm dev dependencies you should have:
* `"babel-core": "6.1.x",`
* `"babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs": "6.1.x",`
* `"babel-preset-es2015": "6.1.x",`
* `"modern-web-dev-build": "0.1.0"`

Once the configuration is updated, get rid of your `node_modules` and `jspm_packages` folders and run `npm run setup`.

Good to go!
