/* Rather than manage one giant configuration file responsible
 for creating multiple gulp tasks, each task has been broken out into
 its own file. Any files in that directory get automatically required below.

 To add a new task, simply add a new task file that directory.
 gulp/tasks/default.js specifies the default set of tasks to run
 when you run `gulp`.
